# UFOs
#  Overview of the Project
The main purpose of this analysis is to help Dana build up a webpage that has the data on UFO sightings across the globe with a dynamic table which allows users to filter the data for multiple criteria at the same time.
# Results
 Once the webpage is loaded in a browser, it shows all the data from the  data file to perform a search is very simple. A user should navigate to the filter search option, then enter the desirable criteria in the white box which they want to filter. for instance, if a user wants to filter the data according to the state, country and shape of UFO sightings, then follow the example shown in the [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HW6T-9Es8vUubP93aaViAM3nevlUqj5U/view?usp=sharing).
# Summary
- The drawback of this webpage is that a user cannot filter the data between two specific dates at the same time.
- In the future development of this project we can add the filter for two given dates at the same time.
- The second recommendation is that we can add an event listener which shows the results as soon as the user enters anything.
